# What is mark3
this projects helps us streamline productivity while browsing the web by organizing bookmarks. We noticed that there is no easy way to store good articles / blogs / podcasts / resources that you come across while surfing the web. You can easily import your bookmarks from chrome/firefox/safari to provide seamless switching. So we’re building a bookmarks manager and an ecosystem of features around it. We currently have a web app and we’re also developing a browser extension to further reduce friction from user interactivity. You can categorize, search, filter, tag, like and share your bookmarks with your friends as well :). We have a ton of amazing features in the pipeline. Ohh and BTW, we also have dark mode :)
